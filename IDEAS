Emergent / Common Ideas from other tools
Twitter
	#tags, @person
Gmail
	(!) red-star/green-checkmark/etc icons

Interaction to mark a note as a todo item
	Mouse
		Select To-do from a list of types
			Advantages: Visual, knowledge in world
			Disadvantages: Takes up screen space
		Having option like the <| option to “drop down” more options.
			Allows people to ignore small icon if unwanted.
			However, curious people will likely get confused.
			Have it be a “turn on / turn off” able system like labs?
	Keyboard
		Include “#todo” in note (or something like this)
		Auto-complete #tags for note creation/edit through magic?
			Advantages: 
			Disadvantages: 
				requires use of tags
requires more typing (less ideal for mobile), 
requires remembering “#todo” - not so bad?

Search Improvements	
	Always provide list of #tags to help user remember “knowledge in the world” !!!
